\problemname{zombie}
The year is 2035, 
the world is in middle of a zombie apocalypse. 

In order to stop the spread,
Safe zones have been set up all across the world. Here one can live a relatively peaceful and normal existence (as long as you don't think about the state of the world)

In order to keep the zombies out of the safe zones, one has to pass a test to enter. 

The test consist of adding two numbers and outputting the result, since zombies are notoriously bad at math.

Gunhildur needs to move from one safe zone to another, but she is afraid she wont pass the test since she is not great under pressure. 
Therefore she needs a way to be able to cheat the test. 

\section*{Input}
The input consist of two numbers given on a single line, seperated by a space. 


\section*{Output}
Output the result of the two numbers added together
