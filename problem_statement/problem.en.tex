The year 2035, the world is in middle of a zombie apocalypse. 

Safe zones have been set up across the world were one can live a relatively normal existence.

in order to keep the zombie out, one has to pass a test when trying to enter a safe zone. 

the test consist of adding two numbers given on a single line, seperated by a space. Since zombies are notoriously bad at math.

Gunhildur needs to move from one safe zone to another, but she is afraid she wont pass the test since she is not great under pressure. therefore she needs a way to be able to cheat the test.
